# qua3osu

This is a rewrite of [qua2osu](https://github.com/IceDynamix/qua2osu) in C#
instead of Python. Using [Quaver.API](https://github.com/Quaver/Quaver.API)
makes conversion a lot easier.

Run the project with the `--help` flag to get everything you need. If you
downloaded from releases, open up a command line and run either
`qua3osu.exe --help` or `dotnet qua3osu.dll --help`, depending on your operating
system.
